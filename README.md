# radar-param-py
This repository contains code and files involving drop size distribution (DSD) data from a Two-Dimensional Video Disdrometer (2DVD) and dual-pol radar data. In the code file, various radar parameters are found and plotted from the DSD data, along with some other user-dominant parameter functions (relative gain, beamwidth, and minimum detectable reflectivity).
